# Code Verification Rules

## Required: Verify All Code Changes

After making any code changes, you must verify the changes by running linting and build commands to ensure code quality and prevent breaking changes.

### Run Verification Commands

Whenever you make code changes, you MUST:

1. **Run the linter** to check for code quality issues:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

2. **Run the build** to verify the code compiles correctly:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

### Fix All Issues

You MUST fix all issues exposed by these verification commands before considering the task complete:

- ✅ **Fix all linting errors** - Address every error and warning reported by the linter
- ✅ **Fix all build errors** - Resolve any compilation or build failures
- ✅ **Verify the fixes** - Re-run the commands after fixing to ensure all issues are resolved

### When to Run Verification

Run verification commands after:
- Creating new files or components
- Modifying existing code
- Refactoring code
- Changing dependencies or configuration
- Any other code changes that could affect the build or code quality

### Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Make your code changes
# ... edit files ...

# 2. Run linter
npm run lint

# 3. Fix any linting issues
# ... fix errors ...

# 4. Run build
npm run build

# 5. Fix any build issues
# ... fix errors ...

# 6. Verify everything passes
npm run lint && npm run build
```

## Why This Matters

- **Prevents Breaking Changes**: Catches errors before they reach production
- **Maintains Code Quality**: Ensures consistent code style and best practices
- **Faster Development**: Identifies issues early when they're easier to fix
- **Team Collaboration**: Keeps the codebase in a working state for all developers
